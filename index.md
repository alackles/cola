# Introduction to Discrete Mathematics

TBD: FULL MOCK SYLLABUS HERE

## Unit 2: Proofs, Sets, and Functions

In this unit, we will learn about the basics of a mathematical proof, and how to use them to operate on mathematical sets and functions. Some of the concepts will be new to you; some will be familiar concepts presented in a new light. **The rest of the course builds on the foundation of this unit**, so be sure to ask questions and gain clarification if you are having trouble with any of the concepts here.

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Identify rules of inference, by form and by name, that are being used in a particular argument
- Apply rules of inference to create a logical argument, when given predicate statements
- Analyze the validity of a given proof or argument using logical reasoning and rules of inference

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Identify logical fallacies and errors in arguments or proofs, given the steps in the argument/proof
- Use the proof techniques direct proof, proof by contradiction, and proof by contraposition to prove simple mathematical statements, given the desired proof technique

### Unit 2 Review

Tips for taking the practice exam:

- Take the exam in the same conditions you would take the normal exam: it is open-note and open-book, so have your materials with you
- Time yourself -- the real exam is scheduled for two hours, and should not take the full time unless you have testing accomodations. Get a sense of how comfortable you are with the material by timing how long it takes you to complete
- Try not to look at the answers before finishing the whole exam
